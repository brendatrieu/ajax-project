      <p>For over a century people from around the world have come to rural Central Kentucky to honor the humble
        beginnings of
        our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln. His early life on Kentucky's frontier shaped his character and prepared him
        to lead
        the nation through Civil War. Visit our country's first memorial to Lincoln, built with donations from young and
        old,
        and the site of his childhood home.</p>
